        <h2 class="text-center">Building a Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App</h2>
        <p>With healthcare becoming increasingly digital, we developed a symptom-based disease diagnosis web app to help users quickly identify potential health issues using their reported symptoms. Built with Flask and powered by a Decision Tree Classifier model, this web app makes it easy for individuals to get accurate health predictions.</p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>People often struggle to identify their illness, especially when symptoms overlap. Our goal was to create a simple tool to provide quick, reliable health predictions based on symptom input.</p>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>Our app allows users to input their symptoms, which are then analyzed by a trained machine learning model to predict possible diseases. The process works as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Symptom Input:</b> Users enter their symptoms through a simple interface.</li>
            <li><b>Machine Learning:</b> A Decision Tree Classifier processes the symptoms to suggest potential diseases.</li>
            <li><b>Instant Prediction:</b> Users receive immediate feedback with predictions of possible conditions.</li>
            <li><b>Detailed Information:</b> The app also provides additional information, such as disease descriptions, precautions, medications, and health tips.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li><b>User-Friendly Interface:</b> The app is easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.</li>
            <li><b>Accurate Predictions:</b> Our model offers reliable disease predictions based on symptoms.</li>
            <li><b>Comprehensive Health Information:</b> The app includes detailed insights into each disease, including treatment and prevention tips.</li>
            <li><b>Educational Content:</b> Access blog posts that expand your health knowledge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>This Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App leverages machine learning to bring healthcare information to users instantly. With a focus on accessibility and user experience, it is designed to empower individuals with the tools they need to understand their health. By combining technology with healthcare, we aim to improve overall health awareness and well-being.</p>
